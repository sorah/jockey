# Jockey - play music

__NOTE:__ still in development! most features are not implemented yet!
Yes, the following things are the FUTURE.

Jockey is simple iTunes DJ controller on the web.

Alternative to [play/play](https://github.com/play/play).
Comparing below.

## Background

In a small hackathon, I provided BGM from my iTunes (using iTunes DJ).

Apple's Remote app for iOS device provided us a way to add songs for members.
But we're writing code. you know, we want a way to add song on my machine.

Yes, we already have a way - GitHub's [play](https://github.com/play/play).
I think this is awesome. But it's little complicated.

I've just wanted to provide controlling iTunes DJ from web.

(Continued to "Why not play?" in below...)

## The Setup

### OS X and iTunes

Jockey is designed for iTunes DJ.

1. Go iTunes' preferences, check 'iTunes DJ'.
2. Open 'iTunes DJ' in the source pane, then click "Settings".
3. Make sure __"Voting" is disabled__.

### Ruby

Jockey is written in Ruby. 1.9.2 or higher is required.

1.9.3 is highly recommended.

### Install

    $ git clone https://github.com/sorah/jockey.git
    $ cd jockey
    $ bundle install

### Launch

    $ bundle exec ./start

<http://localhost:9292/>

__NOTE:__ we should do `thin -R config.ru` instead of `rackup` because of Sinatra's bug.

## Features

* Control iTunes DJ from web
* Realtime notification (using HTML5 EventSource)
* Voting songs

  * Powerful browsing

* APIs (of course!)

## Why not play?

[play](https://github.com/play/play) has the following problems (I think):

* Using [Pusher](http://pusher.com/)

  * Pusher, not bad. It's awesome.
  * but there are limitation: 20 connections, 100000 messages / day in free account... (See [Pricing](http://pusher.com/pricing) page)

* Why use Redis?

  * I don't think play needs redis.

I've wanted just control my iTunes DJ, so consider using play if you want more features.

But, some feature requests may be accepted. give me pull request :)
